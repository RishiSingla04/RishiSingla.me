      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p class='info'> I am Rishi, an enthusiastic and diligent student with a great foundation in programming and graphics design. I worked as a camp leader during the summer of 2022 and had the opportunity to shadow senior staff. I was given the opportunity to take on a larger leadership role and guide my peers. I am a tech geek with an interest in robotics. I enjoy attending hackathons and working in a team environment. I am currently seeking an internship for Summer of 2023 and would love to connect.  </p>
