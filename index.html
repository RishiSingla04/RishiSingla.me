         graphics design. I worked as a camp leader duringthe summer of 2022 and had the opportunity
        <br />
         to shadow senior staff. I was given he opportunity to take on a larger leadership role and guide
        <br />
         my peers. I am a tech geek with an interest in robotics. I enjoy attending hackathons and
        <br />
        working in a team environment. I am currently seeking an internship for Summer of 2023 and
